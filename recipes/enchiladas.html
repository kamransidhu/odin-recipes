    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tortillas - 2</li>
        <li>Chicken thigh - 200g</li>
        <li>Bell Peppers</li>
        <li>Jalapenos</li>
        <li>Cheese - amount to preference</li>
        <li>Greek yoghurt - amount to preference</li>
        <li>Corriander - One handful</li>
        <li>Half of a white onion</li>
        <li>Chicken stock - 1 cup</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken with the spice rub of your choice (I chose garlic, salt, oregano and paprika) and throw it in the oven at 225 for 20-25.</li>
        <li>Cut bell peppers in half, and put on a baking tray covering the peppers and the tray in a drizzle of oil.</li>
        <li>Once the peppers have slightly blackened, put them in a bowl and cover the top, leave for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 10 minutes, peel the skin for the bell peppers and throw the skin away.</li>
        <li>To a blender, add; Half of the onion, corriander, stock, jalapenos and the roasted peppers.</li>
        <li>Once blended, taste and adjust as needed, (I added too much corriander so I can add water to dilute and/or add lemon juice to offset flavour).</li>
        <li>The chicken should have been cooked by now, so take out and prepare your tortilla; Add yoghurt to a third of the tortilla, then add chicken and cheese.</li>
        <li>Fold the tortilla and add to a baking tray deep enough to hold the sauce we are going to bake the enchiladas in.</li>
        <li>As mentioned, place the wrapped tortilla in the tray and cover in the sauce you have just made, cover the enchiladas with cheese if you want.</li>
        <li>Bake for up to 10 mins, making sure the cheese has not burned.</li>
        <li>Take out, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
